Welcome to pylift's documentation!
==================================

**pylift** is an uplift library that provides, primarily, (1) fast uplift modeling implementations and (2) evaluation tools. While other packages and more exact methods exist to model uplift, **pylift** is designed to be quick, flexible, and effective. **pylift** heavily leverages the optimizations of other packages -- namely, `xgboost`, `sklearn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `scipy`.

**pylift** has two main features:

#. A `TransformedOutcome` class (inheriting a more general `BaseProxyMethod` class) that allows for full end-to-end   uplift modeling.
#. An `UpliftEval` class that allows for evaluation of any model prediction. This class is used within the            `TransformedOutcome` class, but can be called independently to evaluate the performance of, for example, scores from  a modeling approach external to **pylift**.

The `TransformedOutcome` class (and so, the `BaseProxyMethod` class) simply wraps `sklearn` classes and functions.    Therefore, it's generally possible to do anything you can do with `sklearn` within `pylift` as well. Advanced usage   of **pylift**, therefore, should feel familiar to those well-versed in `sklearn`.
